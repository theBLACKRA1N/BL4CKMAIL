# Python BL4CKMAIL Email Bomber v1.1 by BLACKRA1N
*Welcome to my first hacking tool. Please stay updated as I plan to add a mass email mode, as well as adding HTML mailing features. Once I complete version 2 I will be combining it with a phishing website hosting script. This way you can host your phishing page AND send the phishing emails to a list of people all at same time! If you would like to contribute or team up on this project, my contact is below.* 
## Requirements:
*If using a GMAIL or YAHOO account, change the settings in your account to "Less Secure Apps". This allows the python script to send emails using their servers.*
## Contact:
*Wire app - @theblackrain*
*I was going to put my email but noticed this is an email bombing thing lol XD*
